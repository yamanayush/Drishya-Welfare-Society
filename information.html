        <h2 class="sectiontitle"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong> </h2>
        <center><img src="image/drishya.jpeg" alt="ngo"></center><br>
        <p>Drishya Welfare Society is a Ratlam based non-profit organization (NGO) Registered under the Society
          Registration Act 1860. It is a dynamic organisation working for the holistic and integrated development of the poor
          and marginalized people of the society, especially youth and women, along with interventions for enhancing the
          quality of life and emphasising on the environment. And water resources.
          <br>
          <br>
          Drishya Welfare Society was set up by a team of committed aspirants and social workers with a strong intent and
          desire to promote self-reliance and sustainability of the people and communities living in the poorer regions of city
          by catalysing voluntary action and community participation.
          <br>
          <br>
          The list of environmental issues is substantial. Challenges of pollution, global warming, natural resource depletion,
          and waste disposal affect the daily lives of billions of people. That’s why every minute of attention on this subject is
          of vital importance. Drishya Welfare Society shows great affection towards mother nature and proposing forced
          solution for green and clean environment.
          <br>
          <br>
          Drishya Welfare Society started its operations with strong felt need of taking proactive steps for empowering
          communities through education and awareness. It was vital important for the organisation to work towards
          awareness of the community, helping them understand their right to services and providing such services.
          <br>
          <br>
          The lack of positive attitude between male and female, and complete absence of basic health services, especially
          for the rural women, made Drishya Welfare Society work in a way which addressed quality of life of people on one
          hand, including health, women empowerment, sustainability development, education, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          Environment and education were taken as a starting point and therefore appropriate efforts were made since the
          beginning to increase the access of communities to plant more and more trees, awaring the benefit of green and
          clean environment.
          <br>
          <br>
          Over time, the organization has gained significant strength and is now well equipped with a qualified and
          committed social workers capable of undertaking the responsibility of the community for their betterment.</p>
